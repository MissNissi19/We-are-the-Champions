We Are The Champions


We Are The Champions is a project developed as part of my coursework on the Scrimba platform. It is a solo project where I implemented the design provided in Figma. The main goal of this project is to provide a platform where individuals can give endorsements to their colleagues and peers in their working environment. Additionally, the project utilizes Firestore for storing and managing endorsement data securely.
